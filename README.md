# Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews

## Project Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews to understand customer satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and make better business decisions. The analysis helps in improving customer retention and attracting new customers.

## Objectives

- Classify reviews as positive or negative
- Understand customer satisfaction
- Identify areas for improvement
- Make better business decisions
- Identify specific aspects of the dining experience that customers are most and least satisfied with
- Understand how different groups of customers feel about the restaurant
- Compare the sentiment of reviews for a particular restaurant to those of its competitors

## End Users

- **Restaurant Owners/Managers**: Gain insights into customer feedback to improve service and menu offerings.
- **Customers**: Seeking information on the quality of a restaurant's food and service.
- **Food Critics/Bloggers**: Using sentiment analysis to support their reviews.
- **Researchers**: Analyzing sentiment trends and patterns in restaurant reviews for academic or market research.
- **Food Delivery Services**: Assessing restaurant ratings and customer feedback to improve partner restaurant selections.
- **Investors**: Gauging the public's perception of specific restaurant chains for investment decisions.

## Solution and Value Proposition

### Solution

The solution involves using language models to analyze restaurant reviews and classify them as positive or negative. The model also identifies specific aspects of the dining experience that customers are most and least satisfied with. This information can help restaurants improve customer satisfaction and overall performance.

### Value Proposition

- **Accuracy**: High accuracy on sentiment analysis tasks.
- **Scalability**: Analyzes large volumes of text data quickly.
- **Flexibility**: Analyzes different types of text data, including restaurant reviews, social media posts, and customer surveys.
- **Ease of Use**: Restaurants can provide a set of reviews and receive the sentiment analysis results.

## Customization

- Utilized knowledge of language and context to improve sentiment analysis accuracy.
- Personal hands-on experience and knowledge applied in the project.
- Data visualization with graphs and heatmaps.
- Employed two models: Multinomial Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifier.

## Modelling

### Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)

- A probabilistic classification algorithm well-suited for text classification tasks.
- Learns the probabilities of each word in the dataset belonging to each sentiment class.
- Predicts the sentiment of new reviews by calculating the probability of the review belonging to each sentiment class.

**Benefits of MNB**:
- Simple to implement and train.
- Effective for text classification tasks.
- Learns from a relatively small dataset of labeled reviews.

### Random Forest Classifier

- A supervised learning technique containing multiple decision trees.
- Takes the average to improve predictive accuracy.
- Higher accuracy and prevents overfitting.

**Benefits of Random Forest**:
- Easy to implement.
- Handles large datasets with high dimensionality.
- Enhances accuracy and prevents overfitting.

## Results

The project achieved the following accuracy scores:
- Multinomial Naive Bayes: 78.5%
- Random Forest Classifier: 74.5%
